Beat Leap
=========

A rhythm game developed by Wave 11


Description
-----------

Every level is made by a grid and a song.
You can move a cube on a grid. Every move you do is accepted only if it's on the beat of the song.
By moving you have to avoid/destroy/collect other cubes that move towards you in the grid.

It's that simple!
